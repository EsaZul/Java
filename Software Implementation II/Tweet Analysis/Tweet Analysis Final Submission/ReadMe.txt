IMPORTANT

This assignment has been all over the place. The assignment has been changing parameters, requirements, etc
that it eventually caught up to me. I had this project done on Friday. I talked to Wenxi Wang about the project
lab and she confirmed that what I had was correct along with my interpretations. I left my completed assignment
at home here in Austin when I went back home. However, it was announced that mentions changed parameters and only
was accepted before and after a space was detected. However I was not home and did not have access to my project.
I had to come back earlier than usual, arrived Sunday, and tried to change my code to meet the new paramets. This
caused many faults that it was no point to have an uncompleted assignment rather than a completed assignment that
was changed last minute. Hope you can understand. Thanks!
